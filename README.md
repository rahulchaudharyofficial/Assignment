# Project Overview

John is an operations manager. He wants to ensure product availability information is populated on
an order by the service rep before the service rep can progress the order from the New stage to the
Fulfillment stage. John wants to capture the warehouse managerâ€™s name who confirmed available
inventory and whether each of the products ordered is in inventory or backordered. Later, when John
views the Order, he wants to see backordered scenarios indicated with red highlights on the order
screen.

    -   Assuming order is available in new stage for Sales Rep to review and decide if move it for next stage or not

    -   Assuming that on each order screen itself it is expected to understand order health
